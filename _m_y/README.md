# REQUIREMENTS
## INTRODUCTION
A Battery is a container in which cell or more cells will contain, where the chemical energy is converted into electricity 
which is used as a source. This project will explain about how the battery will charge and discharge in Matlab.

### CHARGING OF BATTERY
Charging a battery reverses the chemical process that occurred during discharge. The electrical energy used to charge a battery is converted back to chemical energy and stored inside the battery.
### DISCHARGING OF BATTERY
The charging of the battery will discharge gradually over the time often we use it or not. Hence the discharging of battery means
it's loosing voltage, or energy.

# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

| ID | DESCRIPTION |   
| --- | --- |
| HR01 | Getting Voltage signal, current signal and SOC % in scope |
| HR02 | In graph the battery percentage shall be increase 0 to 100 |
| HR03 | In graph the battery percentage shall be decrease 100 to 0 |

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

| ID | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| LR01 | Bus selector is connected to the cell to generate voltage, current and SOC% signas | 
| LR02 | In display the battery percentage shall have shown decreasingly from 0 to 100 |
| LR02 | In display the battery percentage shall have shown decreasingly from 100 to 0 |
